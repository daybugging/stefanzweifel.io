# stefanzweifel.io

Hi. You found the uncompiled source code of my personal [website](https://stefanzweifel.io).

## Workflow

This project uses [Metalsmith](http://metalsmith.io) and Gulp for it's build process.

## How to setup the site on your local machine

You need [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com).

```
$ git clone https://github.com/stefanzweifel/stefanzweifel.io.git
$ cd stefanzweifel.io
$ npm install
$ gulp serve
```

There are also command for `sass`, `uncss`, `js`, `deploy` and `textlint`.

## Continous Integration

~~This website has some simple tests, which will be triggered everytime someone pushes to this repository. [See Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/stefanzweifel/stefanzweifel.io/)~~
