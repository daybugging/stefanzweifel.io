> TL;DR: [Screeenly](http://screeenly.com) is an API to create website screenshots. You can checkout the source code on [Github](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/screeenly).<br>
> I'm currently redesigning the application. Screenshots you see here, will change in the future.

Since january I'm a big fan of the PHP framework [Laravel](http://laracel.com) and in my freetime I'm often playing around with it. Recently I had the idead to create an API to create screenshots from websites. You could use the API in other applications, where you have to display the current look of a given website in a nice dashboard.

So I sat down created the first version of [screeenly.com](http://screeenly.com).

The whole thing is simple:

- You sign up with your Github Account
- Grab the API Key
- Create API-Requests
- Handle responses in your application
- Profit

After you created some screenshots, you see them in your dashboard for the next seven days.

Furthermore, I created screeenly during the Google I/O 2014. I was really impressed by the new Material Design Guidelines and so I tried to implement them.
