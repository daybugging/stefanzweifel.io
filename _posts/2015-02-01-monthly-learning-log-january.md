Earlier this year I had the idea to publish a monthly post containing resources I used in my day to day work or I found while browsing the web. This is the first part of this series. I do this mostly for me, so I have like a "developer diary", but maybe you find something for you too.

## ngBoilerplate

At work, we decided to set our focus this year on Angular. Even though no one in our team is an expert in Javascript frameworks, in our eyes Angular does a perfect job and has a great community.      
While researching we stumbled upon ngBoilerplate, a premade Gruntfile which handles the whole build-process of a modern Angular application. I modified the script so it's even more flexible and gives you the ability to create new Angular applications, just with one terminal command. (I hope I can share this script, or some of the ideas behind it in the upcoming weeks).

## json-api

Ever built an API? I did and it's hard. You have to think through so many scenarios and nearly every day you want to restructure youre responses. Luckily there are smart people out there, who want to create a web-wide standard for JSON APIs.    
I will redo a sideproject I've been working on for some time and will try to implement the standard. Maybe this is something for you or your team too.
