##Releases

### Lynx Ghost Theme
Have you heard of [Ghost](http://tryghost.com). It's a new blogging plattform, still in his early days. It runs on node.js and it's super fast. My [blog](http://blog.wnx.ch) runs on Ghost and I wrote a custom theme for it.

You find the code and install instructions on [Github](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/lynx).

### Uberspace Scripts

I merged all my sites and projects in 2013 to [uberspace](http://uberspace.de). For me, it's the Best hosting provider in Europe. You can pay what you want and you get access to all this nice tools, which you only get on managed servers (SSH, Node.js, Redis, Ruby, and much more).
I wrote some snippets / scripts which are quite handy. For example, a script which puts a backup of your whole server on your local NAS. (Just in case :))

You find the snippets on [Github](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/uberspaceScripts).
