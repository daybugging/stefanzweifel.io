##Releases
> Things between sideprojects and code snippets

### Lynx Ghost Theme
I really like [Ghost](http://tryghost.com). On a rainy afternoon I quickly created a simple Ghost theme. It's not ground breaking but I like it (However I use the default theme currently).

You find the code and install instructions on [Github](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/lynx).


### Uberspace Scripts

I merged all my sites and projects in 2013 to [uberspace](http://uberspace.de). For me, it's the Best hosting provider in Europe. You can pay what you want and you get access to all this nice tools, you only get on managed servers (SSH, Node.js, Redis, Ruby, and much more).
I wrote some snippets / scripts which are quite handy. Like a script which create a backup of your whole server on your local NAS.

You find the snippets on [Github](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/uberspaceScripts).

##Stuff I Use
