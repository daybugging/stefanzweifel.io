### Uberspace Scripts

I merged all my sites and projects in 2013 to [uberspace](http://uberspace.de). For me, it's the Best hosting provider in Europe. You can pay what you want and you get access to all the nice tools, you only get on managed servers (SSH, Node.js, Redis, Ruby, and much more).
I wrote some snippets / scripts which are quite handy. Like a script which creates a backup of your whole server on your local NAS.

You find the snippets on [Github](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/uberspaceScripts).

### Lynx Ghost Theme
I really <del>like</del> liked [Ghost](http://tryghost.com). On a rainy afternoon I quickly created a simple theme. It's not ground breaking but I like it (However, since I discovered Jekyll and built this site I abandoned Ghost).

You find the code and install instructions on [Github](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/lynx).

##Stuff I Use
I'm the one in our office which knows every new app or service, that emerged from the ground of the internet. So here's a list of my most used services and apps.
