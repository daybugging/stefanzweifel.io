As you already read on the frontpage, I'm a web developer.
At [2media](http://2media.ch) I create rich websites and webapplications, wich make the internet a better place. Mostly for agencies and insurances.

In my spare time, I like to [code or design](/portfolio) on my own. I also like to [play videogames](http://tv.wnx.ch) on my *Playstation 4*, take some [photos](#) or to read a chapter of *"A Song of Ice and Fire"* (#freetyrion).
