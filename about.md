Hi there, I'm a **fullstack developer**.<br>
I currently work at [2media](http://2media.ch). We are a small agency located in Zurich. We create websites and webapplications, mostly for insurance companies and advertise clients.

In my spare time, I like to [code and design](/portfolio) on my own. Since I started to work in this business my head is full of ideas I would like to turn into real products.

**However, you can't always work**. So I often [play on my Playstation 4](http://tv.wnx.ch), go outside and take photos or read a chapter of *"A Song of Ice and Fire"* (#freetyrion).
