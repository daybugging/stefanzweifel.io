I'm a web developer.
At [2media](http://2media.ch) I create websites and webapplications, which create rich experiences for insurance companies.

In my spare time, I like to [code or design](/portfolio) on my own. I also like to [play videogames](http://tv.wnx.ch) on my *Playstation 4*, take [photos](http://photo.wnx.ch) or to read a chapter of *"A Song of Ice and Fire"* (#freetyrion).

If you wan't more information about myself, just send me an [email](mailto:hello@wnx.ch) or [download my CV](#).
