Hi there, I'm a web developer.<br>
I currently work at [2media GmbH](http://2media.ch). We are a small agency located in Zurich. There I create rich websites and webapplications, mostly for insurance companies and advertise clients.

In my spare time, I like to [code and design](/portfolio) on my own. Since I started to work in the web business my head is full of ideas I would like to turn into real products.

However, you can't always work. So I often [play](http://tv.wnx.ch) on my *Playstation 4*, go outside and take [photos](http://photo.wnx.ch) or read a chapter of *"A Song of Ice and Fire"* (#freetyrion).

If you wan't more information about myself, just send me an [email](mailto:hello@stefanzweifel.io) or [tweet]({{ site.data.urls.twitter }}).
